## \[0.1.0]

- [`58ae1d9`](https://github.com/thefrontside/simulacrum/commit/58ae1d9d5719775a7595ec9bbf55b2c015a892bf) This simulator is a base to iteratively build a simulator for use in published simulators in `@simulacrum` scope or custom implementations elsewhere. This includes the components likely to be used in each simulator (server, router, data store) and pieces to enable quickly spinning up a simulator to get started as through an OpenAPI spec.
