This simulator is a base to iteratively build a simulator for use in published simulators in `@simulacrum` scope or custom implementations elsewhere. This includes the components likely to be used in each simulator (server, router, data store) and pieces to enable quickly spinning up a simulator to get started as through an OpenAPI spec.
